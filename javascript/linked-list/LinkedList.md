# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
 singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail)

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

* create Linked list class and Node class 
* implement three method 
 * insert
 * toString 
 * includes
 * insert After
 * insert Before
 * kthFromEnd
* testing each method in the testing file. 


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
in insert method the Big(o) equal n

in toString method the Big(o) equal n beacuse using while loop it take n time to execute.

in includes method the Big(o) equal n
beacuse using while loop it take n time to execute.

in insertBefore method the Big(o) equal n

in insertAfter method the Big(o) equal n

in kthFromEnd method the Big(o) equal n

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
* insert: insert new node 

* toString: Returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

* includes: Returns Boolean, check the value is exists  in the linked list
